🎬 Top-N Movie Recommendation System
A content-based movie recommendation system that recommends Top-N movies using a weighted average score, powered by TensorFlow.

📌 Overview
This project provides movie recommendations based on a weighted average of user ratings and other relevant features (e.g., number of votes). TensorFlow is used for processing, model creation, and efficient computation.

🎯 Objective: Recommend the most relevant Top-N movies to users based on popularity and rating quality.

📊 Weighted Average Formula
We use a modified version of IMDb's weighted rating formula:

Weighted Average Score=(𝑣⋅𝑅)+(𝑚⋅𝐶)/𝑣+𝑚

Where:

R = average rating for the movie

v = number of votes for the movie

m = minimum votes required to be listed in Top-N

C = mean rating across the dataset

This helps balance popularity and rating quality.

🧰 Tech Stack
🧠 TensorFlow – For numerical computation & possible deep learning extensions

🐍 Python 3.x

🐼 Pandas – Data preprocessing

📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

📁 CSV/JSON – Dataset storage

📂 Dataset
We used a movie dataset containing:

Movie titles

Ratings

Number of votes

Other metadata (genres, etc.)

You can use datasets from sources like:

IMDb

Kaggle Movie Datasets

🧪 How It Works
Load and clean the dataset

Compute average rating (R), total votes (v), and mean rating (C)

Set a vote threshold (m) for minimum votes

Apply the weighted average formula

Sort movies by score and select Top-N

Display recommendations
